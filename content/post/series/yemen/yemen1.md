This is a series about photographers that captured Yemen, and a bit of context. Part1 - What Yemen Was

If you wish to know something about the history of Yemen you should check Wikipedia or your physical encyclopedia. But, if you want not so much information and to gather in one place some photographers and talks about their photographs, well, that’s what I try to do in this series.

I’d like to recap write down a bit of the Yemen history, that seems relevant to me. Also, here I want to analyse photographers, from Yemen and outside Yemen, who risked their lives to take stills from that land, to show us what that land was once, and is now.

### What Yemen Was
Ethnic groups in Yemen are just one: Arabs. But the reality is more complicated, as usual. Yemen has a constant history of divisions. In the beginning, it was all about trade across the strait of Bab el-Mandab involving modern-day Yemen, Ethiopia, and Eritrea. That was good from ~1.000 BC and 300 AC. After, Jewish and Christians arrived and, around the 7th century, Islam spread quickly. A lot of dynasties have followed one another over time from the 9th to 16th centuries. The more important was the Rasulid dynasty.

Here follow a coin during the Rasulids dynasty, 1335, found at Aden.

In the early 20th century the country was divided between Ottoman and British empire. The former stayed in the northern part, including Sana’a that was its capital from 1918 to 1948 and then Ta’izz (until the end of Ottoman domination in 1962, when the Yemen Arab Republic arose).

The British occupied the south and eastern part and had Aden as capital. In 1967 they left, and an independent state with a Marxist-Leninist orientation arose (and obviously it was called People’s Democratic Republic of Yemen).
These two parts unified in 1990 to form the Republic of Yemen.

#### Before 1990
On the declining Ottoman Empire, a civil war started on the north side (1962-1970). Saudi Arabia and the British tried to help the kingdom. Rebels were backed by Egypt and Soviets. Rebels won, after 200.000 casualties. It all started on the 26th September 1962 with a coup d’etat by radical Republicans, led by the army. Wikipedia has a great page on this war (here).

Relevant facts to me, are the siege of Sana’a (started Nov 5, 1967, when rebels entered in Sana’a). After that, there was a series of fights and deads and street capital executions. By Feb ’68 the siege was lifted, and republican rebels won the war. In 1970 cease-fire became effective.

That’s for the north and Sana’a.

#### What about the south?
The south and Aden was occupied by the British since 1839. In 14th Oct 1963, a grenade exploded at Aden Airport. So the British declared a state of emergency.
A sort of guerrilla started, especially in Aden streets (January 1967) where British forces opened fire 40 times towards demonstrators. Following British support to Six-Day war (June 1967), Arabs intensify their rebellion.

_Aden in 1967 (ph. unknown)_

The 30th of November 1967, the British withdrew (without an agreement on succeeding governance), and in 1970 the People’s Republic of South Yemen was instituted.

So, overcoming foreign occupation and civil wars, the North organize itself in the Yemen Arab Republic (est. 1970) and the South in the People’s Republic of South Yemen (est. 1970).
