A photo that changed the world in 1989 is back on front pages.

In 1989 students started to protest in Tiananmen Square in Beijing and probably they had no idea that they would have ended up facing tanks.

It all started in mid-April. I was 18 at the time, I was living in a western country where having civil rights was standard. But I realized that students around my age were not in my situation and were asking the Chinese government to give more freedom of speech, free press, right to manifest.
That's why my peers and I started demonstrating too. We went into the central plaza of my town, and we build our tents, we tried to express solidarity with those students from different part of the world.

Each early morning we read newspapers and figure out how it was going.  Chinese students began a hunger strike in May when Gorbachev visited Beijing. Hundreds of thousands gathered in Tiananmen Square to join the protest.  The Russian president was starting a new era in USSR, talking about _glasnost_ and _perestroika_. We were thrilled. We knew that the world was about to change.  Probably we had the same feeling that those guys in Tiananmen Square. We both knew that something was going to happen.  And something happened.

June 4th, 1989, soldiers started killing people, thousands of them. And tanks started cleaning the Tiananmen Square. We will never know the exact number of deaths.  On the morning of June 5th, journalists were forced to stay in the hotel and some of them, on a balcony, saw this great scene: a human facing tanks.  It has probably been in that very moment that I had concrete evidence that images are powerful, even more than words.

**Stuart Franklin**, one of those reporters, talks about the history of the photo on an article on The Guardian [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/photography-blog/2014/jun/03/stuart-franklin-tiananmen-square-tank-man">link</a>].
Tanks were approaching. Tanks are scary because they are machines and you can’t talk to machines. And you can’t oppose them because they are strong and able to throw down houses and barricades. 
But one bold man was capable of stopping a column of tanks. At least for the time needed for journalists to take videos and pictures and tell the whole world how evil dictatorships are. Words like repression and courage are linked forever to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

This other image is less famous but even more impressive. The man is a tiny dot in the bottom left corner of the pictures. And a lot of tanks are approaching. He waits for them. Without fear. Ready to do what needs to be done.

This is another compelling image (by **Liu Heung Shing**/AP Photo).

Here follow two other examples of how peace and courage can be shown by photographs.

This one is by **Bernie Boston** and was taken in 1967 in Washington D.C., during a protest against the war in Vietnam. Guns are at point blank, but the guy has no fear while he’s seriously engaged in filling the rifle barrel with flowers.

In 1968 **Ladislav Bielik** took this photograph in Bratislava, where a bare-chested man stood in front of a tank. In those days troops and shells from the Soviet Union, Poland, East Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria invaded Czechoslovakia. There’re some links with Tiananmen.  In spring 1968, Dubcek, as secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, wanted to grant freedom of speech, free press, and loosening of restrictions on travel. Soviets didn’t like these reforms and invaded the country.  The Warsaw Pact Army didn’t find armed resistance but a series of suicides by self-immolation (Jan Palach was one of them) and frequent citizen protests. Emil Gallo, the bare-chested man in the picture, was one of them. A plumber, standing to symbolize the weakness of his country (nude in front of a tank) but also the extraordinary moral strength of a nation in front of the brutality of occupiers.
The strength of these pictures and the humans portrayed in them is something that changed the world. And can’t be forgotten.

Back to Tiananmen square in 1989, it's impossible to forget because of these pictures, of course, but also because of commercial brands that nowadays like to use emotion rather than product specifications to convince people to buy their products.

**Leica** is a German company very famous in photography history. It has 5 stores in China and, according to South China Morning Post [<a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3006817/leica-camera-backs-away-promotional-video-depicting-tiananmen">link</a>], 20-30 more are scheduled to open in coming years. Also, Leica has an important partnership with Huawei

In mid-April 2019, Leica published a commercial video on its youtube channel. The video was immediately shot down in China and the word "Leica" was banned on the internet. Shortly after, Leica removed the video and apologized, saying that the video was not "officially sanctioned." "Leica, a company's spokesperson, said, must, therefore, distance itself from the content shown in the video and regrets any misunderstandings or false conclusions that may have been drawn."
The ad was made by F/Nazca Saatchi & Saatchi. The agency said that the production of the short film took more than 1 year.

Here is the video, re-uploaded on the web by a series of youtube channels.

The main object of the video is Tiananmen events in 1989 (as declared at the beginning of the film), but the video also parallels Chinese regime with Africans mercenaries and with (what it seems to be) Isis. Probably that's too much, especially considering that the Chinese government is easy to be triggered.

The famous scene of Tiananmen Square took the 5th of June, 1989, is a photograph that will stay forever as an icon of XX century and, unfortunately for China and its amnesia, as an icon of democracy.
