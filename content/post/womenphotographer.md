Womenphotographer vol. I is an exhibition held in Berlin (6th Dec 2018 to 10th Feb 2019) with the aim of showcasing works by female photographers, curated by Gisela Kayser and Katharina Mouratidi.

As a man, I got some interest in that. First of all, I am working on a project (April 2019) about how the cinema represented women during its history. Also, I’ve been falling in love with the work and life of Toni Frissell, an outstanding photographer that innovated this art (we’ll talk about her in the coming weeks).

I went to #womenphotographer to see good pictures but also to see if there’s some gender-specific point of view. I mean: do women can shot photos in a different way than men? In other words: does make sense to celebrate women photographers.
I came to the conclusion that more than their photos, it’s interesting to celebrate their lives, in many cases, they’re not so easy compared to the ones of their male colleagues.

In this vol. I (hope to see soon a vol. II, maybe with Toni Frissell included…) only one picture is more meaningful because a woman took it.

American Girl, Florence, 1951 is taken by Ruth Orkin (an American photographer, 1921-1985). The story of this photo can be found on Orkinphoto.com, a very good website worth a look [link]. From my point of view, it’s interesting to compare the face of the girl (a friend of the photographer) with the gestures and postures of Italian guys all around. For women, catcalling is generally a bad thing and this picture really represents how bad it is.

Other good shots are from Elionor Carucci (an Israeli-American photographer, b. 1971). You can bet there’s a woman touch here, but to me, they’re just good shots with very interesting lights, colors, and framing.

Vivian Meier is the most exciting recent discovery. She took a lot (i mean thousands) of pictures. Probably she saw just a little few of them. But the strength of these shots is great. And if you think of her (a disgraced Mary Poppins) and unaware subjects (who are they? how they ended their lives?), well, it’s touching.

Finally, a photo seems relevant to me was by Dorothea Lange. Ms. Lange (American photographer 1895 – 1965) probably deserve more extensive coverage. Here, I just report one of her shots in the exhibition.

this “dance” with black farmers working on the fields… well… wow.

So, this #women-photographer vol. I showcased a series of good photos of very interesting (female) photographers. Maybe a bit more depth in their bios would have helped to fully understand the specificities of those women. But anyway, hope to see soon a vol. II.
